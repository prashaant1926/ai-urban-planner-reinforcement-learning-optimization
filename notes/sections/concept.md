This research explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to urban planning optimization, specifically focusing on the complex interplay between zoning decisions, transportation networks, and environmental outcomes. The system will be trained on real-world geographical information systems (GIS) data, traffic patterns, and environmental metrics to propose urban design solutions that minimize both commute times and pollution levels.

The core innovation lies in developing a multi-objective optimization framework that can balance competing urban planning priorities while maintaining practical feasibility. The reinforcement learning agents will learn to propose modifications to existing urban layouts, considering factors such as population density, commercial zone placement, public transportation routes, and green space distribution.

A crucial aspect of this research is the integration of human domain expertise through a structured feedback loop. Urban planning professionals and stakeholders will evaluate the AI-generated proposals, providing qualitative and quantitative feedback that will be incorporated into the learning process, creating a hybrid human-AI decision support system.
